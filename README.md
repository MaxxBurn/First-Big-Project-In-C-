# First Big Project In C++
The idea behind this program was the creation of a Text based mmorpg. It includes features such as leveling up , fighting bosses , picking your own class , picking between which abilities you want to use in a battle , taking damage , dealing damage . The player has armor , magic , attack , health included as so do the enemies. 

There are 2 dungeons :

1.Tomb of Nazaric(Inspired by the anime Overlord)

2.Black Desert(Inspired from the famous MMORPG Black Desert Online by Pearl Abyss)

The user gets to decide which area he wants to clear first then after killing the boss (if he manages to) the game ends.

(UPDATE IN PROGRESS) 

After being inspired by my professor , i decided to continue the project. Things that will be added in the next game patch :
1. Item drops
2. Potion usage in dungeons
3. Leveling up
4. Acquiring new skills while leveling up
5. Mob Surprise attacks 
6. Equipment bar which will consist of a sword and helmet as of currently
7. Story will be added to the game eventually
8. NPC's you can talk to
