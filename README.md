# First Big Project In C++
The idea behind this program was the creation of a Text based mmorpg. It includes features such as leveling up , fighting bosses , picking your own class , picking between which abilities you want to use in a battle , taking damage , dealing damage . The player has armor , magic , attack , health included as so do the enemies. There are 2 dungeons :
1.Tomb of Nazaric(The name came from an anime called Overlord)
2.Black Desert(yes the idea of the name came from the MMORPG Black Desert Online)
The user gets to decide which area he wants to clear first then after killing the boss (if he manages to) the game ends.
